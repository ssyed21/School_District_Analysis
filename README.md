# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
    - The purpose of this notebook is to show evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically in the reading and math grades for Thomas High School (THS). The program replaces the THS scores with NANs and then redoing the school district analysis. 
## Results
### District Summary affected
    - The district summary was not affected that much by the changes made for THS as it mainly is looking at the total number of schools, students, and budget. There was a small change in the average scores, passing scores and overall passing scores but was not significant enough.  
### School Summary affected
    - The School summart was affected in that the THS % passing in all categories increase greatly. There were increases in % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Overall Passing.
### How does replacement of 9th grade scores affect THS performance against other schools
    - THS's performance in comparison to other schools now shows it as a top performing school rather than a lower performing school.
### How does changing 9th grade scores affect:
    - Math and reading scores by grade
        - Because we replaced all the 9th grade scores with Nan it only affects THS, while the other schools are unaffected. 
    - Scores by school spending
        - Replacement does not affect the values for the school spending as the number of students is still the same. 
    - Scores by school size
        - The same occurs as scores by school spending as the size isn't changed only the scores.
    - Scores by school type
        - The overall scores of charter schools only slightly increased as the major jump of scores from THS was able to help.
## Summary
    - The four major changes were that the % Passing Math increased, % Passing Reading increased, % Overall Passing increased, and THS became a top performing School.
